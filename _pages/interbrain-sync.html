<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">We performed studies using fNIRS ‘hyperscanning’ 
  (simultaneous recording of brain activities from more than one participant) during social interactions (both verbal and non-verbal) between 
  typically developing children and their mothers during naturalistic toy playing at a table. We demonstrated the success in employing phase 
  transfer entropy, which captures directionalities during interactions (child-led vs mother-led) compared to more conventional methods (e.g., 
  wavelet coherence), to measure inter-brain synchrony:</span></p>

  children, a recent NIHR funded efficacy trial of a speech and language therapy in CI children will examine how child-mother inter-brain synchrony 
  changes following the therapy. </span></p>
