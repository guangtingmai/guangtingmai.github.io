<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">Hyperscanning (simultaneous recording of brain activities 
  from more than one participant) is increasingly used in social neuroscience to study the neural processes during interpersonal interactions. We 
  performed studies using fNIRS hyperscanning in typically developing children and their mothers during a naturalistic table-based toy playing 
  paradigm. We demonstrated success in employing phase transfer entropy, which enables capturing directionality (child-led or mother-led neural 
  interactions) compared to more conventional methods (e.g., wavelet coherence), to measure inter-brain synchrony:</span></p>

  children, longitudinal changes in child-mother inter-brain synchrony will be examined along with <a href="https://www.impact-trial.ac.uk/">an NIHR
