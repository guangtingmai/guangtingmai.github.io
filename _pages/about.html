<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;line-height: 1.5;display: block"><strong>Bio</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.5;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.15vh">My childhood and teenage years were spent in an enclosed 
  campus in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University">southern China</a> where I attended undergrad physics. I made a 
  drastic turn after many struggles in physics, spending a number of sobering years wandering about psychoacoustics and neurolinguistics as a junior 
  lab assistant in <a href="https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~lel/research/index.html">Hong Kong</a>. Later I moved to the UK for MSc and PhD both in 
  cognitive neuroscience.</span>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.5;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.15vh">Starting from working with typically listening individuals, 
  I have gradually been trying to learn how speech processing might go wrong or become effortful in clinical individuals. My PhD (with Prof 
  <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/2817-peter-howell/">Peter Howell</a>) studied speech listening in noisy environments in people with age-related 
  hearing loss. At the time I was also jointly sponsored by Prof <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/2168-ilias-tachtsidis">Ilias Tachtsidis</a> with 
  a grad school cross-disciplinary training program that enabled me to learn to apply multimodal brain imaging tools (EEG, fNIRS and tDCS) on typical and 
  clinical individuals. I later worked as an NIHR-funded postdoc with Prof <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/people/douglas.hartley">Douglas Hartley</a> 
  studying neural synchrony between the brains of typically listening or cochlear-implanted children and their mothers ('inter-brain synchrony'), and most 
  recently under Dr <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/82001-holly-robson">Holly Robson</a>’s MRC Clinician Scientist Fellowship studying neural speech 
  tracking in people who have aphasia after experiencing a stroke. I am still parts of both teams overseeing analyses of neuroimaging data from aphasic and 
  cochlear-implanted individuals, whilst currently funded by a Wellcome ECA fellowship studying neural processing of audiovisual speech in adult cochlear 
  implant users, working with Dr <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/">Matt Davis</a> and co-advised by Dr 
  <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/bob.carlyon/">Bob Carlyon</a> and Prof Hartley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.5;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.15vh">I am a native Cantonese-Mandarin bilingual. I have been a 
  Scottish resident since the pandemic and practice work-life balance by commuting across River Tweed and northeast England.</span></p>
