<p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;line-height: 1.45;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.12vh">My childhood and teenage years were spent in an enclosed 
  campus in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University">southern China</a> where I attended undergrad physics. I made a 
  drastic turn after many struggles in physics, spending a number of sobering years wandering about psychoacoustics and neurolinguistics as a junior 
  lab assistant in <a href="https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~lel/research/index.html">Hong Kong</a>. Later I moved to the UK for MSc and PhD both in 
  cognitive neuroscience.</span>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;line-height: 1.45;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.12vh">Starting from working with typically listening individuals, 
  I have gradually been trying to learn how speech processing might go wrong or become effortful in clinical individuals. My PhD studied speech 
  listening in noisy environments in people with age-related hearing loss. I later worked as an NIHR-funded postdoc with Prof <a href="https://www.
nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/people/douglas.hartley">Douglas Hartley</a> studying neural synchrony between the brains of typical listening or cochlear-
  implanted children and their mothers ('inter-brain synchrony'), and most recently under Dr <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/82001-holly-robson">
  Holly Robson</a>â€™s MRC Clinical Scientist Fellowship studying neural speech tracking in people who have aphasia after experiencing a stroke. I am 
  still part of both teams overseeing analyses of neuroimaging data from aphasic and cochlear-implanted individuals, whilst I am now studying neural 
  processing of audiovisual speech in adult cochlear implant users, working with Dr <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/">Matt 
  Davis</a> and co-advised by Dr <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/bob.carlyon/">Bob Carlyon</a> and Prof Hartley.</span></p>

  a Scottish resident since the pandemic and practice work-life balance by commuting across River Tweed and northeast England.</span></p>
