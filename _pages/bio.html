<p span style="font-size: 11.5pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height: 1.5;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.2vh">My childhood and teenage years were spent in an enclosed 
  campus in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University">southern China</a> where afterwards I attended undergrad physics. I made a 
  drastic turn after many struggles in physics, spending a number of sobering years learning about psychology of human speech perception as a lab assistant in 
  <a href="https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~lel/research/index.html">Hong Kong</a>. I later moved to the UK in search of a clearer path for meaningful contributions.</span>
<p span style="font-size: 11.5pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height: 1.5;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.2vh">Starting from working with typically listening individuals, 
  I have gradually been trying to learn how speech perception/processing might go wrong or become effortful in clinical individuals. For MSc I learnt from Prof 
  <a href="https://sheffield.ac.uk/ahpnm/people/human-communication-sciences/patricia-e-cowell">Patricia Cowell</a> about how speech perception and production are 
  affected by hormones. My PhD (with Prof <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/2817-peter-howell/">Peter Howell</a>) studied speech listening in noisy environments in 
  people with age-related hearing loss. A grad school cross-disciplinary training fund kindly sponsored by Prof <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/2168-ilias-tachtsidis">Ilias Tachtsidis</a> 
  enabled me to develop multimodal brain imaging skills to apply on both typical and clinical individuals. I later worked as an NIHR-funded 
  postdoc with Prof <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/people/douglas.hartley">Douglas Hartley</a> studying neural synchrony between typically listening 
  or cochlear-implanted children and their mothers ('inter-brain synchrony'), and most recently under Dr <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/82001-holly-robson">Holly Robson</a>’s 
  MRC Clinician Scientist Fellowship studying neural speech tracking in people who suffer from aphasia after experiencing a stroke. I am still parts of both 
  teams overseeing neuroimaging analyses in aphasic and cochlear-implanted individuals, whilst currently funded by a <a href="https://wellcome.org/research-funding/schemes/wellcome-early-career-awards">Wellcome ECA</a>
  fellowship on audiovisual speech processing in adult cochlear implant users, working with Dr <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/">Matt Davis</a> 
  and co-advised by Dr <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/bob.carlyon/">Bob Carlyon</a> and Prof Hartley.</span></p>

  Scottish resident since the pandemic and practice work-life balance by commuting across River Tweed and northeast England.</span>
