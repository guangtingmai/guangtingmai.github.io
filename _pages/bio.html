<p span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height: 1.5;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.2vh">My childhood and teenage years were spent in an enclosed 
  campus in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University">southern China</a> where afterwards I attended undergrad physics. I made a 
  drastic turn after many struggles in physics, spending a number of sobering years learning about psychology of human speech perception as a lab assistant in 
  <a href="https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~lel/research/index.html">Hong Kong</a>.</span>
<p span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height: 1.5;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.2vh">I later moved to the UK in search of a path for meaningful 
  contributions. Starting from working with typically listening individuals, I have gradually been trying to learn how speech perception/processing might go wrong 
  or become effortful in clinical individuals. My MSc thesis was how speech perception and production are affected by hormones advised by Prof 
  <a href="https://sheffield.ac.uk/ahpnm/people/human-communication-sciences/patricia-e-cowell">Patricia Cowell</a>. My PhD (with Prof 
  <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/2817-peter-howell/">Peter Howell</a>) studied speech listening in noisy environments in people with age-related hearing loss. 
  A grad school cross-disciplinary training fund kindly sponsored by Prof <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/2168-ilias-tachtsidis">Ilias Tachtsidis</a> enabled me 
  to develop multimodal brain imaging skills (functional near infrared spectroscopy and EEG) to apply on both typical and clinical individuals.</p>
<p span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height: 1.5;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.2vh">Afterwards I had been an NIHR-funded postdoc at 
  Nottingham with Prof <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/people/douglas.hartley">Douglas Hartley</a> looking at neural synchrony between typically listening 
  or cochlear-implanted children and their mothers ('inter-brain synchrony'), and most recently under Dr <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/82001-holly-robson">Holly Robson</a>’s 
  MRC Clinician Scientist Fellowship at UCL studying neural speech tracking in people who suffer from aphasia after experiencing a stroke. I am still parts of both teams 
  overseeing neuroimaging analyses in aphasic and cochlear-implanted individuals. I am currently funded by a 
  <a href="https://wellcome.org/research-funding/schemes/wellcome-early-career-awards">Wellcome ECA</a> fellowship at Cambridge studying audiovisual speech processing 
  in adult cochlear implant users, working with Dr <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/">Matt Davis</a> and co-advised by Dr 
  <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/bob.carlyon/">Bob Carlyon</a> and Prof Hartley.</span></p>
<p span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height: 1.5;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.2vh">I am a native Cantonese-Mandarin bilingual. I have been a 
  Scottish resident since the pandemic and practice work-life balance by commuting across River Tweed and northeast England.</span>
