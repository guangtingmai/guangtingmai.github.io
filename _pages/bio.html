  campus in southern China where I attended undergrad in physics. After many struggles in physics, I made a drastic turn spending a number of 
  sobering years wandering about psychoacoustics and neurolinguistics as junior lab assistant in Hong Kong. Later I moved to the UK for MSc and 
  PhD both in cognitive neuroscience.</span>

  I have gradually been trying to learn how speech processing might go wrong or become effortful in clinical populations. My PhD studied speech 
  listening in noisy environments in people with age-related hearing loss. I then worked as an NIHR-funded postdoc with Prof Douglas Hartley 
  studying inter-brain synchrony during interactions between typical listening or cochlear-implanted children and their mothers, and most recently 
  under Dr Holly Robsonâ€™s MRC Clinical Scientist Fellowship studying neural speech tracking in people who have aphasia after experiencing stroke. 
  I am still part of both teams overseeing analyses of neuroimaging data from aphasic and cochlear-implanted individuals, whilst I am now studying 
  neural processing of audiovisual speech in adult cochlear implant users with Dr Matt Davis and co-advised by Dr Bob Carlyon and Prof Hartley.
