  campus in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University">southern China</a> where I attended undergrad in physics. I made a 
  drastic turn after many struggles in physics spending a number of sobering years wandering about psychoacoustics and neurolinguistics as a junior 
  lab assistant in <a href="https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~lel/research/index.html">Hong Kong</a>. Later I moved to the UK for MSc and PhD both in 
  cognitive neuroscience.</span>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;line-height: 1.45;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.12vh">Starting from working with typically listening individuals, 
  I have gradually been trying to learn how speech processing might go wrong or become effortful in clinical individuals. My PhD studied speech 
  listening in noisy environments in people with age-related hearing loss. I then worked as an NIHR-funded postdoc with Prof Douglas Hartley 
  studying inter-brain synchrony during interactions between typical listening or cochlear-implanted children and their mothers, and most recently 
  under Dr Holly Robsonâ€™s MRC Clinical Scientist Fellowship studying neural speech tracking in people who have aphasia after experiencing a stroke. 
  I am still part of both teams overseeing analyses of neuroimaging data from aphasic and cochlear-implanted individuals, whilst I am now studying 
  neural processing of audiovisual speech in adult cochlear implant users, working with Dr Matt Davis and co-advised by Dr Bob Carlyon and Prof 
  Hartley.</span></p>

  a Scottish resident since the pandemic and practice work-life balance by commuting across River Tweed and northeast England.</span></p>
