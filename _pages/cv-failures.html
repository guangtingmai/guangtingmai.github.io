<p span style="font-size:11pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height:1.5;display:block;margin-bottom:0.2vh">Academic setbacks after leaving my hometown started from
  three consecutive years of failed (not-even-anywhere-close) MPhil/PhD applications in Hong Kong followed by an MSc application to Canada in the fourth year 
  due to substandard undergrad performances, and then to the UK (possibly because of an ulta-late submission in March/April).</span></p>
<p span style="font-size:11pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height:1.5;display:block;margin-bottom:0.2vh">By the end of PhD, I failed at four project grant applications
  (all rejected at the first round) that tried to secure support for a postdoc position. Meanwhile I failed at four interviews in a row before starting the 
  first postdoc at Nottingham during the midst of the Pandemic. I failed at a faulty postion application a year later (sent out without feedback).</p>
<p span style="font-size:11pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height:1.5;display:block;margin-bottom:0.2vh">I failed at five fellowship applications - three before/during 
  the Pandemic (Sir Henry Wellcome, British Academy, NIHR); two afterwards (Wellcome ECA, MRC Career Development).</span></p>
