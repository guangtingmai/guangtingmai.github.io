<p span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Tahoma;line-height:1.4;display:block;margin-bottom:0.2vh">Academic setbacks (2009-2013) after leaving my hometown 
  started from consecutive failed (naively, not-even-anywhere-near) MPhil/PhD applications in Hong Kong three years in a row followed by an MSc application to Canada in the 
  fourth year due to substandard undergrad performances; and one to the UK in the fifth (possibly due to an ultra-late submission in March/April).</span></p>
<p span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Tahoma;line-height:1.4;display:block;margin-bottom:0.2vh">By the end of PhD (2019-2020), four project grant applications 
  aiming to secure a postdoc position were rejected (all at the first round) alongside another four consecutive interview failures before starting the first postdoc 
  in the midst of the Pandemic. I failed at a faulty application a year later (sent out without feedback).</p>
<p span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Tahoma;line-height:1.4;display:block;margin-bottom:0.2vh">Meanwhile I failed at five fellowship applications - three 
  before/during the Pandemic (Sir Henry Wellcome, British Academy, NIHR) (2019-2020); two afterwards (Wellcome ECA, MRC CDA) (2024).</span></p>
<p span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Tahoma;line-height:1.4;display:block;margin-bottom:0.2vh">More to come. Failures are frustrating but may not always be bad
  since sometimes ECRs may be able to gather stronger support afterwards. <strong>Keep Calm and Carry On!</strong></span></p>
