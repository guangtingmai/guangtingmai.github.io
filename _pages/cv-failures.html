<p span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Tahoma;color: black;line-height:1.55;display:block;margin-bottom:0.2vh">Academic setbacks since leaving my hometown (2009-2013)  
  started from consecutive failed (not-even-anywhere-near) MPhil/PhD applications in Hong Kong three years in a row (substandard undergrad performances) 
  followed by an MSc application to Canada in the fourth year and one to the UK in the fifth (an ultra-late submission in March/April).</span></p>
<p span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Tahoma;color: black;line-height:1.55;display:block;margin-bottom:0.2vh">By the end of PhD (2019-2020), four project grant applications 
  aiming to secure a postdoc position were rejected (all at the first round) alongside another four consecutive interview failures before starting the first postdoc 
  in the midst of the Pandemic. I failed at a faculty application a year later (sent out without hearing back). Meanwhile I also failed at five fellowship applications 
  - three before/during the Pandemic (Sir Henry Wellcome, British Academy, NIHR) (2019-2020); two afterwards (Wellcome ECA, MRC CDA) (2023-2024).</span></p>
<p span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Tahoma;color: black;line-height:1.55;display:block;margin-bottom:0.2vh">More to come. Failures are frustrating but may not always be 
  bad since sometimes ECRs may be able to gather stronger support afterwards with quality efforts. Things are in your own hands to fight fears and anxiety.
