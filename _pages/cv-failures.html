<p span style="font-size:11pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height:1.5;display:block;margin-bottom:0.2vh">Academic setbacks after leaving my hometown started from
  three consecutive years of failed (not-even-close) MPhil/PhD applications in Hong Kong followed by an MSc application to Canada due to substandard undergrad
  performances, and then to the UK (York because of an ulta-late submission in March/April).</span></p>
<p span style="font-size:11pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height:1.5;display:block;margin-bottom:0.2vh">By the end of PhD, I failed at four project grant applications
  (all rejected at the first round) that tried to secure support for a postdoc. Meanwhile I failed at four interviews in a role (Manchester, Cambridge and 
  Nottingham) before starting the first postdoc at Nottingham in the midst of Pandemic. </span></p>
