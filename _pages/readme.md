<span style="font-size: 12pt;">I am a Wellcome Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/">MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit</a> (CBU) at Cambridge.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">I train as a cognitive neuroscientist studying brain processing of speech and language. I study the neural processes that underlie how the brain integrates audio (sounds we hear) and visual (lip movements we see) information during speech comprehension by adult cochlear implant users. I have also been working on projects studying neural speech processing in people with post-stroke aphasia and social neural interactions in typical listening and cochlear implanted children.
