<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.35;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.12vh">My interests focus on three brain processes as lenses to 
  understand typical and atypical human speech processing: (1) ‘neural tracking’ (how brain signals align and respond to millisecond-scale acoustic 
  and linguistic features) of continuous speech; (2) functional connectivity between cortical (cross-modal sensory and higher-order cognitive and 
  language-related) regions; and (3) inter-brain synchrony (brain-to-brain ‘communications’) via ‘hyperscanning’ during interpersonal interactions. 
  I am keen to understand how these processes are shaped/altered by sensory auditory or higher-level cognitive and language comprehension disorders, 
  and what roles they may play during brain reorganisation that compensates for these disorders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.35;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.12vh">I combine neuroimaging methods of <strong>electroencephalography</strong> 
  (EEG) (measuring neural tracking) and <strong>functional near infrared spectroscopy</strong> (fNIRS) (measuring functional connectivity and inter-brain synchrony).

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.35;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.12vh">These are several projects I have been involved in:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.1;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.05vh">   <a href="https://guangtingmai.github.io/neuraltrack-typical/">-	Neural tracking of auditory speech in typical listening adults</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.1;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.05vh">   <a href="https://guangtingmai.github.io/neuraltrack-hearingloss/">-	Neural tracking of auditory speech in adults with age-related hearing loss</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.1;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.05vh">   <a href="https://guangtingmai.github.io/interbrain-sync/">-	Inter-brain synchrony during mother-child interactions</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.1;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.05vh">   -	Neural tracking of auditory speech in post-stroke aphasia</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.1;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.12vh">   <a href="https://guangtingmai.github.io/crossmodal-ci/">-	Neural tracking of audiovisual speech in cochlear-implanted adults</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.35;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.12vh">Hopefully these pieces of work will not only advance 
  understanding of brain processing of speech but also contribute to developing useful clinical tools for objectively monitoring speech 
  comprehension outcomes, esp when reliable behavioural measures are not easy to obtain in many clinical individuals; for the long term, contribute 
  to bases for neuroscience-inspired innovation and rehabilitation to support – not limited to hearing loss or aphasia – but also wider 
  neuropsychological conditions (e.g., neurodivergence and neurodegeneration) when day-to-day speech comprehension and communication become 
  challenging.</span></p>
