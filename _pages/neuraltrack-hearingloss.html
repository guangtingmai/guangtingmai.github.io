<p><div class="white-frame"><span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">Over 70% adults have mild-to-moderate hearing loss in their 
  later life (e.g., >70 yrs old). This condition may not affect listening in quiet but it often causes challenges in speech comprehension in 
  daily noisy listening environments compared to young normally hearing people. Age-related hearing loss (or 'presbycusis') is also known as one of the early 
  risk factors of dementia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">We conducted studies that investigated how ageing and hearing 
  loss contribute to atypical sensory neural tracking of speech (brainstem frequency following response (FFR) to fundamental frequency and neural 
  phase locking to speech envelopes in the auditory cortex) in both quiet and noisy backgrounds and how these sensory tracking activities are 
  associated with behavioural performances of speech recognition in noise in ageing adults:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">Questions also arise that it is difficult to distinguish 
  contributions between atypical neural speech tracking and various co-occurring factors (e.g., cognitive declines) to breakdown of speech understanding following 
  ageing and hearing loss. Simple regression analyses may not solve such issue due to collinearity between these factors and neural tracking. Also it is challenging 
  to disentangle age and hearing loss (as they are always highly correlated) and neural tracking signatures that may also be correlated with each other. We thus employed 
  more proper statistical models combining principal component analyses and mediation models (neural mediation on the effects of age and hearing loss on speech 
  behaviours) to illustrate how individual differences in speech-in-noise perception can be better explained by sensory tracking of speech in adults with a wide 
  range of age and hearing status:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: Tahoma;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">We studied functional changes over time in temporal and 
  frontal cortices using fNIRS in ageing adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss following a training program of speech recognition under noisy 
  backgrounds. We illustrated promising success in observing neuroplasticity via fNIRS where we recorded significant improvements in brain 
  functions during speech-in-noise perception:</span></p>
