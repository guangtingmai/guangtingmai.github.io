<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">Over 70% adults have mild-to-moderate hearing loss in their 
  later life (e.g., >70 yrs old). This condition may not affect listening in quiet but it often becomes challenging for speech comprehension in 
  day-to-day noisy listening environments compared to young normally hearing adults and it is known as one of the risk factors of dementia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">We conducted studies to investigate atypical sensory neural 
  tracking of speech acoustic properties (brainstem frequency following response (FFR) to fundamental frequency and phase locking of speech 
  envelopes in the auditory cortex) in ageing adults compared to young and normally hearing individuals. We showcase how ageing and hearing loss 
  contribute to these sensory tracking activities in both quiet and noisy backgrounds and the associations between these activities and behavioural 
  performances of speech recognition in noise in ageing adults:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">Questions also arise that it is difficult to distinguish 
  contributions of atypical neural speech tracking and various co-occurring factors (e.g., cognitive declines) to breakdown of speech comprehension 
  following ageing and hearing loss. Simple regression analyses may not solve such issue due to the collinearity between these factors and neural 
  tracking. We thus used more proper statistical models to illustrate how individual differences in speech-in-noise performance can be explained by 
  sensory tracking of speech besides other potential age-related factors:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">We studied functional changes over time in temporal and 
  frontal cortices using fNIRS in older adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss following a training program of speech comprehension under noisy 
  backgrounds. We illustrated promising success in observing neuroplasticity via fNIRS that records improvements in brain functions during 
  speech-in-noise perception in people with hearing loss:</span></p>
