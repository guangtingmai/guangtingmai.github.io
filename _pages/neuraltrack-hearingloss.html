<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">Over 70% adults have mild-to-moderate hearing loss in their 
  later life (e.g., >70 yrs old). This condition may not affect listening in quiet but it often becomes challenging for speech comprehension in 
  day-to-day noisy listening environments compared to young normally hearing adults and it is known as one of the risk factors of dementia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">We conducted studies to investigate atypical sensory neural 
  tracking of speech acoustic properties (brainstem frequency following response (FFR) to fundamental frequency and phase locking of speech 
  envelopes in the auditory cortex) in ageing adults compared to young and normally hearing individuals. We showcase how ageing and hearing loss 
  contribute to these sensory tracking activities in both quiet and noisy backgrounds and the associations between these activities and behavioural 
  performances of speech recognition in noise in ageing adults:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">Along this line, we further studied predictive coding of 
  speech by showing the roles of cortical speech tracking at different frequency bands may play for neural ‘sharpening’ (neural responses to expected 
  semantic inputs) vs. prediction errors (responses to unexpected semantic inputs):</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">Recent efforts also looked at how cortical tracking of 
  pitch contours indexes effortful listening of speech in noisy environments in typically listening individuals:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">‘Frequency-following response’ (FFR) is a subcortical 
  (albeit extra auditory cortical sources) phase-locked response to the fundamental frequency of speech, known as a potential index for various hearing 
  and language-related disorders (e.g., hearing loss, developmental dyslexia, autism). We studied FFR in typical listening by looking at how FFR 
  is affected by day-to-day psychophysiological status, e.g., arousal or consciousness, across the adult lifespan:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.1vh">We also looked at how changes in neural excitability in the
