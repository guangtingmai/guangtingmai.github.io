<span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.5vh">I am a Wellcome Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/">MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit</a> (CBU) at Cambridge.</span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;line-height: 1.4;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.5vh">I train as a cognitive neuroscientist studying brain processing of speech and language. I study neural processes that underlie how the brain integrates audio (sounds we hear) and visual (lip movements we see) information during speech comprehension by adult cochlear implant users. I am also involved in projects studying neural speech processing in people with post-stroke aphasia and neural processes during social interactions in typical listening and cochlear implanted children.</span>
