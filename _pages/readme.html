  Wellcome Research Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/">MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit</a> (CBU) at Cambridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.5pt;line-height: 1.5;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.13vh">I train as a cognitive neuroscientist studying human brain 
  processing of speech and language. My Wellcome fellowship studies speech processing in hearing-impaired adults with cochlear implants by exploring how 
  these indivdiuals' neural systems with different sensory modalities (audition and vision) work together to integrate audiovisual information to understand 
  speech (<a href="https://guangtingmai.github.io/crossmodal-ci/">CrossModal-CI</a>). I am also involved in ongoing projects studying neural processing of 
  speech by adults sufferring from post-stroke aphasia and studying neural processes during social interactions in typically hearing children and in children with 
  cochlear implants.</span></p>
