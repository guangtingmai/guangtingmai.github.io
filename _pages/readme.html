  Wellcome Research Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/">MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit</a> (CBU) at Cambridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.5pt;line-height: 1.5;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.13vh">I train as a cognitive neuroscientist studying human brain 
  processing of speech and language. My Wellcome fellowship studies neural processes that underlie how the brain integrates audio and visual information during 
  speech comprehension by adult cochlear implant users (<a href="https://guangtingmai.github.io/crossmodal-ci/">CrossModal-CI</a>). I am also involved in ongoing 
  projects studying neural processing of speech comphrehension by post-stroke aphasic adults and studying neural processes during social interactions in typical
  hearing or cochlear implanted children.</span></p>
