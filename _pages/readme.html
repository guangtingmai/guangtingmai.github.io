  Wellcome Research Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/">MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit</a> (CBU) at Cambridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.5pt;line-height: 1.5;display: block;margin-bottom: 0.13vh">I train as a cognitive neuroscientist studying human brain 
  processing of speech and language. My Wellcome fellowship studies speech processing by hearing-impaired adults with cochlear implants, specifically, 
  how their brains' different sensory (auditory and visual) systems work together to integrate audiovisual information and support speech comprehension 
  (<a href="https://guangtingmai.github.io/crossmodal-ci/">CrossModal-CI</a>). I am also parts of ongoing projects studying neural processing of 
  speech by adults sufferring from aphasia after a stroke and studying neural processes during social interactions in typically hearing or cochlear 
  implanted children.</span></p>
